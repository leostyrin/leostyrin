## Hi :)

I am currnetly a student at Leeds Beckett University studying computer science.

My favourite piece of code I have writen so far in my programming career is the web application I made for my A Level programming project which allowed a user to search the site for a career recommendation. This site was inspired by my time doing work experience at the Department for Work and Pensions digital team where I was given the task of designing an app which allowed a user to find a job in their area as well as create a CV.  

I am currently working on improving my knowledge in languages like python, java and C inside and outside my classes. Alongside this I would also like to broaden my knowledge and skills in back end development since I have already worked on front end development and would like improve my knowledge on all ends of development so that I am more well rounded as a developer.
